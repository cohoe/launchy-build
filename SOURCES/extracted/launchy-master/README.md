Launchy
=======

Launchy is a free utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, your desktop icons, 
and your file manager. Launchy indexes and launches your applications, documents, project files, 
folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!

This is a fork from SourceForge project https://sourceforge.net/projects/launchy/
